Client / Server Development

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is essential for long-term project success, especially when systems are expected to grow or change over time. In this project, the CRUD Python module from Project One was carefully designed using object-oriented principles to separate database access logic from the user-facing dashboard. This modular approach made it easy to connect the dashboard widgets in Project Two without rewriting core database functionality. One major advantage of working this way was reusability — I could simply import the AnimalShelter class and immediately have full database control within the dashboard. In the future, this same CRUD module could easily be adapted for new applications, such as administrative tools, mobile apps, or expanded dashboards for other animal shelters or non-profits.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces and focusing on both user needs and technical requirements. When Grazioso Salvare requested specific database and dashboard features, I first mapped out the relationships between animal types, rescue categories, and necessary visualizations. Compared to earlier assignments in other courses, this project demanded a stronger focus on real-world client needs, dynamic filtering, and visual storytelling through data. Moving forward, I would continue using modular development, iterative prototyping, and client feedback loops to build future databases or systems that not only meet technical standards but also create value for organizations.

Computer scientists build systems that solve problems and improve people's lives by connecting data, users, and decisions. In a project like this, my work helps a company like Grazioso Salvare by making it easier for them to analyze shelter data, identify ideal rescue candidates, and ultimately save more animals. By creating accessible, interactive dashboards powered by clean backend systems, computer scientists make complex information understandable and actionable — and that makes a tangible difference in the missions of organizations around the world.
